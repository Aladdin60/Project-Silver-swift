# Project-Cashflow-Forecasting

 This project involves to improve cash flow forecasting and financial stability. This study highlights the importance of accurate cash flow forecasting for business operations and the role of modern technologies in enhancing forecasting reliability and accuracy. The analysis covers the financial data from 2019 to 2023 and provides insights into cash flow trends and their implications on a business's financial health. 

The primary objective of the study is to explore the fundamental aspects of cash flow forecasting, identifying the relationship between various financial variables and cash flow projections. By evaluating different forecasting methods, the study aims to recommend effective strategies for mitigating cash flow volatility and improving financial stability. 

This research employs an analytical approach, utilizing several forecasting models including ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, OLS Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Improved Random Forest. The study evaluates these models using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to determine their effectiveness in predicting cash flow. 

The findings indicate that advanced forecasting models, particularly LSTM and Random Forest, significantly enhance forecast accuracy, aiding in better financial decision-making. The study also highlights the importance of regular updates to forecasting models and the need for continuous training of financial teams. 

The study suggests that a Business must effectively utilize these advanced forecasting techniques to optimize its financial resources, withstand adverse economic conditions, and maintain competitive advantage.
